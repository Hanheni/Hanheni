- 👋 Hi, I’m Hanheni bust most people call me Nheni, french living in Poland because work called me in this god forsaken country.
-  I currently am a 2D animator that happens to be curious enough to dip her toes in front-end developpment.
-  The more you start things the less likely you are to finish them but oddly enough both coding and 3D are progressing along my Polish skills. So, yay me!
-  As much as I would love to participate in anything I'm also the kind to procrastinate so. Don't call me.
-  No seriously, don't try to reach me, at best Google might point you in some sort of direction. Not necessarily the right one, but. You know.
